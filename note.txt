SQL allows for four types of commands:
Create, Insert
Read - Select
Update
Delete, Drop

SQL supports many commands to access data, including:
AVG
COUNT
DISTINCT
LOWER
MAX
MIN
UPPER

SQL offers additional commands we can utilize in our queries:

WHERE -- adding a Boolean expression to filter our data
LIKE -- filtering responses more loosely
ORDER BY -- ordering responses
LIMIT -- limiting the number of responses
GROUP BY -- grouping responses together


CREATE TABLE table (column type, ...);
INSERT INTO table (column...) VALUES(value, ...);
DELETE FROM table WHERE condition;
UPDATE table SET column = value WHERE condition;>>>>>>>> <column = value, column=value,....>
